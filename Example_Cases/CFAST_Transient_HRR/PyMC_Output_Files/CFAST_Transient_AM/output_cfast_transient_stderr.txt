/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pymc/StepMethods.py:1179: UserWarning: 
Covariance was not positive definite and proposal_sd cannot be computed by 
Cholesky decomposition. The next jumps will be based on the last 
valid covariance matrix. This situation may have arisen because no 
jumps were accepted during the last `interval`. One solution is to 
increase the interval, or specify an initial covariance matrix with 
a smaller variance. For this simulation, each time a similar error 
occurs, proposal_sd will be reduced by a factor .9 to reduce the 
jumps and increase the likelihood of accepted jumps.
